    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody"><p>As a Software Engineer and homelabber, I always run VMs for testing and daily use. Choosing a suitable and rock-solid hypervisor is always a topic for me. I have tried Proxmox (Proxmox Virtual Environment), VMWare ESXi (with vCenter) and Hyper-V Server over the years, and I now use Proxmox most of the time. But This year, I came across XCP-ng, which I had never heard of. XCP-ng is a fork from XenServer, a community-driven hypervisor, a closer solution to the ESXi. </p>

<h1 id="Impression-of-the-XCP-ng-stack"><a href="#Impression-of-the-XCP-ng-stack" class="headerlink" title="Impression of the XCP-ng stack"></a>Impression of the XCP-ng stack</h1><p>The XCP-ng hypervisor doesn’t come with a WebGUI for management, so I need to set up a centralized management platform called <strong>Xen Orchestra</strong>, which is developed by the same team as XCP-ng.</p>
<p>When it comes to Xen Orchestra, I really like its versatile backup options. My favourite one is <strong>Rolling Snapshots</strong>. With this feature, I can roll back VMs immediately if I accidentally do something wrong, without the need for creating snapshots manually (which I usually forget), or even create a new VM directly from a snapshot. It provides a much lower RTO and RPO than delta backup and full backup.</p>
<p>Also, unlike Proxmox, I can manage multiple XCP-ng servers without requiring a cluster. Currently, I run two Proxmox clusters independently. I have to manage them through two separate WebGUI, which is inconvenient and error-prone.</p>
<h1 id="Choosing-a-hypervisor"><a href="#Choosing-a-hypervisor" class="headerlink" title="Choosing a hypervisor"></a>Choosing a hypervisor</h1><p>As a personal user, the way of choosing a solution is different from businesses. Paying for commercial products and support is not a big deal for companies – they get what they pay for. As a free user, no matter which one I choose, I have to deal with most issues with my own knowledge and skills and rely heavily on the community.</p>
<h2 id="Some-highlights-of-Proxmox"><a href="#Some-highlights-of-Proxmox" class="headerlink" title="Some highlights of Proxmox"></a>Some highlights of Proxmox</h2><p>Proxmox VE is kind of an all-in-one system solution. It comes with fully unlocked capabilities in terms of computing, storage, backup, and management center. I can do most of the configurations through its WebUI. Since it has a decentralized architectural design (or, say, a hyper-converged infrastructure), I don’t need to worry about a single point of failure.</p>
<p>Despite its benefit, however, there is often some hacking work through SSH to make it run smoothly. But that introduces another highlight. Since Proxmox is built on top of Debian, I can apply all my professional skills to deal with problems and even learn something during the process. It’s easier to find solutions from both Proxmox and Linux communities.</p>
<h2 id="XCP-ng-stack-is-great-but-with-some-issues"><a href="#XCP-ng-stack-is-great-but-with-some-issues" class="headerlink" title="XCP-ng stack is great, but with some issues"></a>XCP-ng stack is great, but with some issues</h2><p>When I try to use XCP-ng and Xen Orchestra, I have to put some effort to get it on and running.</p>
<p>For example, to start my very first VM – Xen Orchestra, I have to manually create and start a VM through CLI, compiling it from source code, only to unlock the paid-only backup feature. It becomes tricky when this management VM doesn’t start (it did happen several times). I have to fix it through CLI or with a little help from <strong>XCP-ng Center</strong>, a management client only on Windows. Control plane high availability is quite crucial to an enterprise environment. However, after some research, I find that Xen Orchestra doesn’t provide a HA solution like vCenter. Maybe I could set up HA on the VM level, but I haven’t tested it yet.  </p>
<p>Also, the <code>Advanced Live Telemetry</code> feature is somewhat unhandy. XCP-ng provides a monitoring solution based on Netdata, but I can’t register the host to Netdata Cloud, probably the reason of its old version (v1.19.0, released on Nov 28, 2019). I can neither upgrade it, nor manually install the official version as it conflicts with the XCP-ng version.</p>
<p>I won’t complain too much, as they are all paid features. There are one-click solutions and full support available for paid users. However, both of the problems can be solved easily on Proxmox. Speaking of observability, I can utilize the official supported metric options (Graphite or InfluxDB), or install whatever I want. Prometheus node exporter and Netdata agent can run flawlessly on Proxmox.</p>
<h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>I didn’t talk much about the capabilities of XCP-ng itself. Well, I did install some Ubuntu and Windows VMs on it, and I won’t doubt its reliability and stability. Since the Xen project has been adopted by many tech giants for long, such as AWS and Alibaba, it’s definitely production-ready and enterprise-ready.</p>
<p>However, as a personal user, as well as a Software Engineer, I have to admit that the XCP-ng stack cannot provide the turnkey solution I need. So I decided to stick to Proxmox as my daily driver. I won’t say Proxmox is perfect, and neither is XCP-ng. They both have their problems. I believe most of my problems can be solved with effort, but I don’t want to spend too much time on it.</p>
<p>Even so, the future of XCP-ng is still promising. It’s unfair to compare both projects without considering how long they have been developed (XCP-ng started in 2018, while Proxmox started in 2008). The XCP-ng team is still actively developing new features. There will be a new management platform called <code>XO-Lite</code> with a redesigned UI&#x2F;UX, which runs directly on XCP-ng for easier management. And I’m really impressed by the CEO of Vates – Olivier Lambert, the creator of XCP-ng and Xen Orchestra. His name always pops up while I’m searching in forums. He is basically an active member of every XCP-ng forum and every thread about XCP-ng. I can feel his passion for his projects. The tech world is changing fast, I’m sure things will be different next time I look back, and I will definitely give it another shot once it fits my need.</p>
